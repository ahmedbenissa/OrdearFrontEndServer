                    "  We ate at Mount Dora, Florida restaurant, food was amazing. Was hot and got it fast.
                    Also while there a Lady was putting in 10 orders not only was the cashier keeping up with her. 
                    But the food came out by the time she was putting in the last order.
                    I call that excellent service.  "‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

                    "got pie hit the spot. Crust was flaky, inside was creamy. Would have liked more veggies. 
                    So glad no corn was in filling. Chicken was nice and shredded versus cut into squares.
                     Was bland, if you like that? It was fine for me, as you can always add what you want if need be. Would get it again!"‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê</p>
